-- Debug the bookings table issue

-- 1. Check if bookings table exists
SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT FROM information_schema.tables 
    WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
    AND table_name = 'bookings'
) as table_exists;

-- 2. If it exists, show its structure
SELECT 
    column_name, 
    data_type, 
    is_nullable,
    column_default
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'bookings' 
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

-- 3. Check if the foreign key relationships exist
SELECT 
    tc.table_name, 
    kcu.column_name, 
    ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
    ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name 
FROM 
    information_schema.table_constraints AS tc 
    JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
      ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
      AND tc.table_schema = kcu.table_schema
    JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
      ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
      AND ccu.table_schema = tc.table_schema
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY' 
    AND tc.table_name='bookings';

-- 4. Check if there are any RLS policies
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    policyname,
    permissive,
    roles,
    cmd,
    qual,
    with_check
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'bookings';

-- 5. Test basic access to the table
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_bookings FROM bookings;
